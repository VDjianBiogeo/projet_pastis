## Finding the South using temperature

Finding a good criteria to actually identify the south of our beautiful and diverse country can be quite a conondrum. Do we base ourselves on climate? On the landscape? Or maybe based on changes in floral composition?

For simplicity's sake (and our own), we chose something rather simple, and yet reflecting the main difference between the north and the south: differences in seasonal temperature for several french cities.

```{r}

library(targets)
tar_config_set(store = here::here("outputs", "pipeline"), 
               script = here::here("analyses", "pipeline.R"))

```

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(tar_read(meteo_data)))
````

By using a useful analysis called a Principal Component Analysis, we can resume the variance in our dataset and identify towns with similar monthly temperatures.

``` {r}
