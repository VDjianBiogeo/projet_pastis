    "text": "0.1 Introduction\nThe Pastis project aims to explore the geographical and subjective perceptions of the French regarding the location of the ‚Äúsouth of France‚Äù. Through a survey, we collect data from participants who provide :\n\ntheir childhood city and their current city of residence ;\ntheir personal view of the boundaries of the south, north, east, and west on a map ;\ntheir sensitivity to cold (on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means ‚Äúnot sensitive to cold‚Äù and 5 means ‚Äúvery sensitive to cold‚Äù).\n\nBy cross-referencing this data, our project seeks to answer intriguing questions:\n\nWhere are the four cardinal points located according to climatic data ?\nWhere do the French really place the ‚Äúsouth of France‚Äù ?\nDoes this perception vary depending on their geographical origin or current place of residence ?\nIs there a connection between perceived sensitivity to cold and the location of the south as identified by respondents ?\n\nThe Pastis project is not just a geographical study; it‚Äôs a cultural and sociological exploration infused with humor and curiosity about what defines the ‚Äúsouth‚Äù for each individual. üçπ",

    "text": "2.1 Finding the South using temperature\nFinding a good criteria to actually identify the south of our beautiful and diverse country can be quite a conondrum. Do we base ourselves on climate? On the landscape? Or maybe based on changes in floral composition?\nFor simplicity‚Äôs sake (and our own), we chose something rather simple, and yet reflecting the main difference between the north and the south: differences in seasonal temperature for several french cities.\nVille\nJanvier\nFevrier\nMars\nAvril\nMai\nJuin\nJuillet\nAout\nSeptembre\nOctobre\nNovembre\nDecembre\n\n\n\n\nBordeaux\n5.6\n6.6\n10.3\n12.8\n15.8\n19.3\n20.9\n21.0\n18.6\n13.8\n9.1\n6.2\n\n\nBrest\n6.1\n5.8\n7.8\n9.2\n11.6\n14.4\n15.6\n16.0\n14.7\n12.0\n9.0\n7.0\n\n\nClermont\n2.6\n3.7\n7.5\n10.3\n13.8\n17.3\n19.4\n19.1\n16.2\n11.2\n6.6\n3.6\n\n\nGrenoble\n1.5\n3.2\n7.7\n10.6\n14.5\n17.8\n20.1\n19.5\n16.7\n11.4\n6.5\n2.3\n\n\nLille\n2.4\n2.9\n6.0\n8.9\n12.4\n15.3\n17.1\n17.1\n14.7\n10.4\n6.1\n3.5\n\n\nLyon\n2.1\n3.3\n7.7\n10.9\n14.9\n18.5\n20.7\n20.1\n16.9\n11.4\n6.7\n3.1\nUsing these temperature data, we should be able to identify which towns show similar monthly temperatures and which ones are radically different. For this, we will use a Principal Component Analysis (or PCA for short).\nIt ordinates individuals (observations, french towns in our case) depending on observed values for quantitative variables (here, temperature for each month). As such, individuals with similar values for studied variables will be close to each other, whereas individuals with different values will be far from each other. Without further ado, let‚Äôs look at the PCA results on our french towns:\nIf we look closely, towns are split on the first axis, with northern cities such as Lille, Brest or Strasbourg on the left side of the first axis, and with southern cities such as Marseille, Montpellier and Nice on the right side of the axis. But we can see two cities that are in the middle of this axis: Lyon and Nantes. Could it be that the ‚Äúsouth‚Äù we so desperatly searched for is below the line traced between Nantes and Lyon? Let‚Äôs map the PCA‚Äôs first axis coordinates on a map of France!\nWell, seems like we were onto something! We can see that we are considered in the south when we go past Lyon and reach Bordeaux. But do people agree with this?",

And that people who think that the north starts above N√Æmes are liars (kisses to our C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur friends)?\nNo, what really mattered in this project is all we learned on project management and data analysis. We learned how to use amazing tools to manage our progress, share our codes and ideas, and allow everyone to have access to it. And for that, some thanks are in order.\nFirst, we would like to thank Fran√ßois, Nicolas, Iago and Aur√©lie for their amazing teachings. We can‚Äôt speak for all of our colleagues, but we‚Äôre pretty sure that the feeling is shared. Your commitment to your talks gave life to this formation, and we have learned a lot this last week.\nWe would also like everyone for their participation in this little project. Thank you for humoring us and our silly ideas.\nAnd finally, we would like to thank all lost souls that ended up on this website and took some of their time to read about our project.\nCheers!\nThe PASTIS team",
