# Pastis project

![](illustrations/emoji_pastis.png){width="26"}

## Introduction

The Pastis project aims to explore the geographical and subjective perceptions of the French regarding the location of the "south of France". Through a survey, we collect data from participants who provide :

-   their childhood city and their current city of residence ;

-   their personal view of the boundaries of the south, north, east, and west on a map ;

-   their sensitivity to cold (on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means "not sensitive to cold" and 5 means "very sensitive to cold").

By cross-referencing this data, our project seeks to answer intriguing questions:

-   Where are the four cardinal points located according to climatic data ?

-   Where do the French really place the "south of France" ?

-   Does this perception vary depending on their geographical origin or current place of residence ?

-   Is there a connection between perceived sensitivity to cold and the location of the south as identified by respondents ?

The Pastis project is not just a geographical study; itâ€™s a cultural and sociological exploration infused with humor and curiosity about what defines the "south" for each individual.
